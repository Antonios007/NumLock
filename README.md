NumLock
=======

Turn on NumLock on a remote desktop machine.  

Whenever I RDP into a Windows machine from my Linux desktop the remote machine NumLock key is switched off. 
The Num Lock on my local keyboard does not map to the remote machine. 
I wrote this program to run on the remote machien so that the NumLock key is switched on. 
I created C++ console app that switches the NumLock on. 
And a C# windows app to report the state of the NumLock key and switch it on or off
